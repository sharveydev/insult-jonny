--- Understanding Testing in Flask Projects ---

Testing in Flask is about ensuring that each part of your application behaves as expected. 

This includes making sure that:

Web pages (routes) load correctly.
User inputs are handled properly.
The application interacts with the database as intended.
Business logic (in models, utility functions, etc.) performs correctly under different scenarios.

--- Types of Tests in Flask ---

Unit Tests: These test individual parts of your application in isolation (like a single function in a utility file or a model method).

Integration Tests: These tests check how different parts of your application work together. For example, testing if a form submission on a route correctly adds data to the database.

Functional Tests: These tests assess the application from the user's perspective. For instance, testing the complete process of adding a new insult through the web interface.
