"""
utils.py: A Collection of Handy Tools for Our App

Think of this file as a toolbox. It contains various helper functions that we use 
across our application. These are small pieces of code that do specific tasks and 
can be used in many different places in our app.

What's Inside:
- Functions that perform common tasks, like formatting dates, checking inputs, 
  or any other repetitive code we don't want to write over and over.
- For example, if we often need to clean up user input, we might have a function 
  here that does that.

How it Connects to Other Files:
- These functions are used in various places like in routes.py or models.py. 
  Anywhere we need the specific task that these functions perform.
- By having these functions in utils.py, we keep our code DRY ('Don't Repeat Yourself'). 
  That means less repeated code and easier changes later.

When to Use This File:
- Add functions here when you have a piece of code that you find yourself using 
  frequently in different parts of your app.
