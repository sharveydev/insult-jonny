"""
run.py: Quick Start Script for Our Flask App

This file is like the 'start button' for our app. When we run this file, it kicks 
off our Flask web application. It's a simple script used primarily during development 
to quickly start the app without needing a more complex setup.

What's Inside:
- This script imports the app instance from our app package and runs it. 
- It's just a few lines of code that tell Python to start our Flask app.

How it Connects to Other Files:
- It imports the Flask app instance from the app package (specifically from __init__.py).

When to Use This File:
- Use this file when you want to start your app locally, like when you're developing 
  or testing changes. It's not typically used in production environments where you 
  would use a more robust server setup.
